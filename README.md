Odin Project - First HTML Project
This project is the first official project in The Odin Project.
It establishes HTML foundations before moving onto CSS.
I already learned HTML and CSS in Codecademya couple of weeks ago,
but I need a course that has in depth training and best practices so I
am familiar with official industry practices.
